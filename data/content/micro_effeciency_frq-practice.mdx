# FRQ 1
Say the government wishes to improve general welfare. What are 3 ways public goods it could use to accomplish this goal?

<FRQ num={1} points={3}>
	<FRQCheck points={3}>
		The government could provide services such as firefighting, hospitals, education, and policing as public goods.
		+1 for each example

# FRQ 2
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
	<li>How does the marginal social benefit differ from the marginal benefit for an individual? Give an example.</li>
	<li> At what point would consumption of a public resource be deemed efficient?</li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={2} points={3}>
	The marginal social benefit differs in the sense that it encapsulates the total benefit for all of society rather than a single person. For example the benefits of a vaccine would be greater to society than to just one person.
	<FRQCheck points={2}>
		<ul>
			<li>State that social benefit encapsulates the total benefit for a wider society.</li>
			<li>Give an example.</li>
		</ul>
	</FRQCheck>
	<FRQCheck points={1}>
		State that the efficient point is the point where marginal social benefit intersects marginal social cost.

<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> What is the difference between SMC and PMC in the graph shown above and what causes that difference? </li>

# FRQ 5
Do the following have negative or positive externalities?
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> Smoking </li>
<li> Vaccines </li>
<li> Pollution </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={5} points={3}>
<FRQCheck points={1}> Negative externality, because secondhand smoke affects other people. </FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}> Positive externality, because vaccination lowers contagion rates which benefits everyone. </FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}> Negative externality, because pollution contributes to climate change, which has negative global impact. </FRQCheck>
</FRQ>
